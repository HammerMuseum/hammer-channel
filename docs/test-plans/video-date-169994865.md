## Description

**Display the video date of the video underneath the video title**

- Is the video date displayed on the page?
- Is the date being pulled from the DAMS?
- If I update the video date in the DAMS, does the description on the video page update to match (either immediately or at an expected point in the future)?

## Requirements to test
- A local setup of the `hammer-video` repository (follow the [getting started](../../README.md) guide to ensure your setup is complete)
- Access to the DAMS (at present this is an Asset Bank trial account [TPM Details here](http://tpm.office.cogapp.com/index.php/pwd/view/649))
- A method of making POST requests to the datastore API e.g Postman or cURL.

**n.b.** As there is no data pipeline yet, the penultimate acceptance criteria can't be met. See end of test plan for replacement steps for when the data pipeline is in place.

## Test Plan
- Add a video to the datastore by following these steps:
    1. Locate a video in the DAMS
    2. Make a request to the Datastore API (see Datastore API documentation for [POST/PUT/DELETE](https://github.com/HammerMuseum/hammer-datastore/blob/master/docs/api.md#CRUD) and [authentication](https://github.com/HammerMuseum/hammer-datastore/blob/master/docs/api.md#Authentication)) to add your video to it.
    3. Once the video has been added to the Datastore, the response should indicate success with a status code of 201.
- Navigate to your video page on the frontend e.g `https://video.hammer.cogapp.com/video/[YOUR VIDEO'S ASSET ID]`.
- The video's date should display under the title.
- The date should match exactly what is in the DAMS.
- Make an update to your video in the Datastore via the API to change the date.
- Refresh the video page.
- The date should now reflect your change.


## Extended test steps
**Only use once the data pipeline is in place**
- Edit the date of your selected video in the DAMS.
- Run the data harvester[?]
- Refresh the page.
- The date should reflect the change.
